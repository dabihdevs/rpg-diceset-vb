# rpg-diceset-vb
A Windows Forms application to roll and compute dices outcomes in RPG games.

This was one of the first applications I created in Visual Basic. Sadly the original Visual Studio project got lost, but I managed to upload the compiled files.

The RPG_DiceSet.exe will run the application.

In the code/ folder I uploaded the code I had written for the application ("Dice.vb", "Form1.vb") plus the component initialization ("Form1.Designer.vb").

I created this application using Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10.
